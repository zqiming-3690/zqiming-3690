👋 Hi, I’m @zqiming-3690

👀 I’m deeply fascinated by the intersection of software development and electrical engineering, with a newfound interest in Swift programming and VisionOS. My background in nano-device fabrication, embedded systems, and IoT product development has set a solid foundation for my venture into creating innovative solutions in the vision technology domain.

🌱 I’m currently learning Swift at the University of Pennsylvania, expanding my skills in software development with a specific focus on applications in vision technology. This learning path complements my ongoing project in developing a startup centered around VisionOS, where we aim to revolutionize how visual data is processed and interpreted in various industries.

💞️ I’m looking to collaborate with fellow innovators and developers who share a passion for cutting-edge technology, particularly in vision systems and mobile app development. My journey from electrical engineering to software development and entrepreneurship in vision technology has equipped me with a unique blend of skills and perspectives that I'm eager to bring to collaborative projects.

📫 How to reach me: Feel free to connect with me via email at zqiming@seas.upenn.edu or phone at +1 6083200818. Whether you're interested in discussing potential collaborations, exploring startup ideas, or just chatting about the latest in software and vision technology, I'd love to hear from you.

😄 Pronouns: He/Him

⚡ Fun fact: Alongside my technical work, I’m also proficient in creative software like DaVinci Resolve, Lightroom, and Rhinos. This artistic side fuels my innovative approach to technology, allowing me to design not just functional but visually compelling solutions.
